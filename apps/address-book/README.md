# Address Book
This app is an address book app challenge completed for Nuvalence

## Deployment Inbstructions
```yarn install`
``` yarn start address-book```

## Project Summary
For this project I built a simple app that retrieves a list of user details and displays this in a table, this also allows the ability to drill into each user for more details.
If I had more time to dedicate to this I would like to implement the following:
- Lazy loading and virtual scrolling of the table data. This would take a few hours.
- Search input of the table data, This would take a few hours.
